bio: Hi! My name is Curtis Bucher and I am a high school student from Newport
  Beach, California. I am interested in Python Programming, Machine Learning,
  Computer Hardware, and Vinyl Records. I always enjoy keeping my mind engaged,
  and at any given time I can expect to be working on several personal projects,
  including this site! I am an avid reader, and greatly enjoy reading a wide
  range of books on a variety of subjects. However, I expecially enjoy reading
  biographies. I love getting coffee with friends, and binging TV shows on
  Netflix. My favorite of which are Friends and the Office.
