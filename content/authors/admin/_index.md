Hello, my name is Curtis Bucher, and I am a Computer Engineering Student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing chess, programming, going to the beach and hiking San Luis Obispo. 

I also particularly enjoy working on engaging personal projects. Currently, I am engaged in an effort to rewrite parts of the CPython interpreter in order to gain a greater understanding of how Python works underneath the hood.
